# FTB-Stickman-Fight-Games
Online stick fight games! Fight PvP stickman battles in the battle arena!

Indeed not open source, but I guess should mention it's existence :)  
Without doubt the biggest project I created. From animation tests via Photoshop & Unity in android lessons in school somewhere in 2021 to a published game on play store with 10k+ downloads.  
It was an interesting journey.

I learned animation, drawing, creating sounds, designing UI, thinking like the customer, marketing, monetization systems, working with other talented people and much more.

The final result is a game that I enjoyed playing with friends & family and we had a lot of fun.  
So if you are for some reason in mine github, check it out :)  
Copy pasting long description from play store:
